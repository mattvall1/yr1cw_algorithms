## University of Greenwich - Computer Science BSc
### The task
Whilst referring to the given text files and their co-ordinates, your task is to determine which of the four quadrants the points fall into and return an appropriate statement stating where they fall. If the point falls onto one of the axes or the origin, then your code should recognise this and output an appropriate statement.
### Notes
- test_data.py is a large file with variables for automated testing purposes
- The testing_analysis folder contains an Excel spreadsheet analysis plus outputted CSV files from each algorithm. These DO NOT match as have been run after the spreadsheet was written
- The data_generator folder contains several custom generators for the different iterations of testing/analysis I used after each solution was completed by team members 
- solution_4.py does not work. It is effectively draft work
